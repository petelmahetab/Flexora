## 🔄 How It Works

### User Booking Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Sign Up] --> B[Onboarding]
    B --> C[Set Location]
    C --> D[Choose Radius]
    D --> E[Browse Classes]
    E --> F[Book Class]
    F --> G[Attend Class]
    G --> H[Confirm Attendance]
```

### Geographic Filtering Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Location + Radius] --> B[Calculate Bounding Box]
    B --> C[GROQ Query with Bounds]
    C --> D[Database Returns Sessions in Rectangle]
    D --> E[Haversine Distance Filter]
    E --> F[Sessions Within Circle Radius]
    F --> G[Sort by Distance]
    G --> H[Display to User]
    
    subgraph database [Database Level]
        C
        D
    end
    
    subgraph client [Client Level]
        E
        F
        G
    end
```

> **Why two-step filtering?** The bounding box query at the database level reduces 100k+ global sessions down to ~100-500 in the user's area. The Haversine formula then accurately filters for the circular radius. This is much faster than calculating distances for every session.

### Subscription Tier Access

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User Subscription] --> B{Which Tier?}
    B -->|Basic| C[Basic Classes Only]
    B -->|Performance| D[Basic + Performance Classes]
    B -->|Champion| E[All Classes + VIP Access]
    
    C --> F[5 classes/month]
    D --> G[12 classes/month]
    E --> H[Unlimited classes]
```

```

### Key Relationships

- **Activity** → Category (what type of class)
- **ClassSession** → Activity + Venue (when and where)
- **Booking** → User + ClassSession (who booked what)

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Clerk Issues

**Problem:** "Clerk: Invalid API key"

**Solution:** Double-check your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` in `.env.local`. Make sure you're using the correct environment (development vs production).

---

**Problem:** PricingTable not showing plans

**Solution:** 
1. Go to Clerk Dashboard > Configure > Billing
2. Ensure you've created products with the correct metadata
3. Check that billing is enabled for your application

---

### Sanity Issues

**Problem:** "Error: CORS not allowed"

**Solution:** 
```bash
npx sanity cors add http://localhost:3000 --credentials
```

---

**Problem:** "Unauthorized" when writing documents

**Solution:** Generate a new API token with "Editor" permissions:
1. Go to Sanity Manage > API > Tokens
2. Create new token with "Editor" role
3. Update `SANITY_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local`

---

### Vercel AI Gateway Issues

**Problem:** AI assistant not responding

**Solution:** 
1. Verify `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is set correctly
2. Check Vercel Dashboard > AI to ensure the gateway is configured
3. Verify you have credits/usage available

---

### Mapbox Issues

**Problem:** Address autocomplete not working

**Solution:** 
1. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` is set
2. Check that your Mapbox token has the correct scopes
3. Ensure your domain is whitelisted in Mapbox settings

---
